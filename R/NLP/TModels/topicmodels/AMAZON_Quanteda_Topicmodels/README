# Data Science: LDA Topic Modeling Application on Amazon Reviews with Topicmodels R library 
 
This article is about an application of Natural Language Processing(NLP) to the  Amazon Reviews, getting a Topic Model  by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis and R.

Topic modeling is a technique that can be used to infer hidden topics in a collection of text documents.  In an ideal context, each topic should be distinguishable from other topics. In the real world,  each topic should be distinguishable enough from others in order for the model to be able to be used.

The data wrangling and modeling are covered by using R base with various libraries but, preferably, xlsx, dplyr, tm, topicmodels, tidytext, tidyverse, gridExtra, grid.. The visualization of the results is generated through ggplot2 or some of its extensions.

The specifics objectives are:
<b><i>
1) Perform the necessary data wrangling.<br>
2) Configure and run the LDA model.<br>
3) Obtain interest results from the model and analyze some outputs considering specifics related probabilities and getting visualizations accordingly.<br>
</i>
</b>

The study of the evolution of the topics over time is a very interesting analysis option to use. We can, for example, visualize the generation and evolution of niches of themes over time, allowing us to control or direct the conformation of the issues in terms of our need.

There are many fields where the Topic Modeling idea can be addressed. The method applied in this project could be extrapolated to various situations and problems typical of human development in general, and scientific research in particular. Research Analysis in all its wide range of possibilities is especially benefited with the implementation and use of the ideas applied to this project, and for sure should have a high value in its daily development.
